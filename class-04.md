# Writing Links

*Links are created using the``` <a>``` element. Users can click on anything between the opening ```<a>``` tag and the closing``` </a>``` tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute*

> The text between the opening ```<a>``` tag and closing ```</a>``` tag is known as link text. Where possible, your link text should explain where ?> visitors will be taken if they click on it (rather than just saying "click here"). Below you can see the link to IMDB that was created on the > > > previous page.  

> Many people navigate websites by scanning the text for links. Clear link text can help visitors find what they want. This will give them a more > > positive impression of your site and may encourage them to visit it for longer. (It also helps people using screen reader software.)

> To write good link text, you can think of words people might use when searching for the page that you are linking to. (For example, rather than > > write "places to stay" you could use something more specific such as "hotels in New York.")



> Links are created using the ```<a>``` element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people > to go to when they click on the link. Users can click on anything that appears between the opening ```<a>``` tag and the closing ```</a>```tag and > will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute. When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full > web address for the site, which is known as an absolute URL.

## Email link

**To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the ```<a>``` element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.**

## Link in new tab 

**If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening ```<a>``` tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank. One of the most common reasons a web page author might want a link to be opened in a new window is if it points to another website. In such cases, they hope the user will return to the window containing their site after finishing looking at the other one. Generally you should avoid opening links in a new window, but if you do, it is considered good practice to inform users that the link will open a new window before they click on it**

# JavaSript functions 

to create a function, you give it a name and then write the statments needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces this is known as a function declaration.


having declared the function, you can then excute all of the statements between its curly braces with just calling it (*the function*)


sometimes a function can have many paarameters and they act just like a variables 

also we can get single value or multiple values out of a function 

if we want more than one value we use array to store them inside it

variable scope there are two scopes 
1. the global scope 
2. the local scope 

global scope when we create variable within it we can use it anywhere within the script in contrary the local variable can't be called outside, in global scope.
