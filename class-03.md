# Lists

1. There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
2. Ordered lists use numbers.
3. Unordered lists use bullets.
4. Definition lists are used to define terminology.
5. Lists can be nested inside one another.

here are examples

# Boxes

there are many ways to manipulate boxes and here are some

> 1. CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
> 2. You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
> 3. You can also control the borders, margin and padding
> for each box with CSS.
> 4. It is possible to hide elements using the display and
> visibility properties.
> 5. Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
> inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
> 6. Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
>boxes containing text and the leading.
> 7. CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
> borders and rounded borders.




# Loops and Switch

1. Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
2. Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
3. Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
4. if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
5. switch statements allow you to compare a value
6. against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
7. Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
8. All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
9. There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements


> SWITCH STATEMENTS

*A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.*

IF ... ELSE
• There is no need to provide an else option. (You can just use an if statement.)
• With a series of if statements, they are all checked even if a match has been found (so it performs more slowly than switch).

> VS. 

SWITCH
• You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.
• If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running (providing better performance than multiple if statements).
