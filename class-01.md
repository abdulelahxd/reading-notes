# How does the Web Works


*when we connect to the web we do that through the* **ISP** *we do type the domain name or the web address into the browser to visit that site*
*while that our computers contact domain name system* **DNS** *servers that will provide you with the requested domain name* 
*and the **DNS** will returns to you computer a unique number which will allow you to start browsing their website*


# HTML

**HTML is to structure the content in almost every web page**
the main parts in html tags

```
<head>
<title>
<body>
        HTML5
        <header>
        <main>
        <footer>
```

HTML p  ages are text documents.
 HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
 Tags are often referred to as elements.
 Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
 Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
 Attributes require a name and a value.
 To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

# Extra Markup

DOCTYPE tell browsers which version of HTML you are using 

YOu can add comments to your code like  <!-- this -->

The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements 

The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together 

<iframs> cut windows into your web page through which other pages can be displayed 

The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page

Escape characters are used to incloude special characters in your pages like <,>



# HTML5 

1. The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure 

2. The new elements provide clearer code 
 
3. Older browsers that don't understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements 

4. to make HTML5 elements work on old version of browsers extra JavaScript needed



# Designing your web page 

1. it's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return 

2. Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site 

3. Wirefrmes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page 

4. Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them 

5. You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style

6. You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present 




# JavaScript 

1. ACCESS CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. For example:
• Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
• Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of emai1



2. MODIFY CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them. For example:
• Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element
• Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
• Change the size or position of an
<i mg> element


3. PROGRAM RULES
You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page. For example:
• A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a fo rm, perform a
ca lculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport).

4. REACT TO EVENTS
You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred. For
example, it could be run when:
• A button is pressed
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on
• A cursor hovers over an element
• Information is added to a form
• An interval of time has passed
• A web page has finished loading


## What is a script 

1. A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in oder to achieve goals
2. Each time the script runs, it might use a subset of all the instructions
3. Computers aooroach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically 
4. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task


JavaScript contain many things 
1. Objects
2. Event
3. Methods
4. Parameters
5. attributes 



# What I learned about Javascripts

1. *JavaScript make the web page interactive with users*
2. *the best practice to put script tag right before body ending tag in html page*
3. *it is best to keep javaScript code in its own file .js*
4. *viewing the source javascript code of the page won't appear on browsers like html*
5. *script is a series of instructions that the computers follow in order to do specific task we wrote*
