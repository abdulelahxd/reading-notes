# Classes and Objects

*Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.*

* **To access a function or variable inside of an object you use notation to access it it's as simple as that**

# Thinking Recursively in Python

* recursion is breaking one big thing into smaller little things

* Recursive functions have a recursive case that splits the big task into smaller tasks and the base case is the smallest task

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage
* fixtures are when you want to have some objects available to all of your tests. Those objects might contain data you want to share across tests.

* coverage is a package that will create a report with every part of the python library that your program used.
