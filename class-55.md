## *Random Module*
The random module provides access to functions that support many operations.


**Random functions**

1. Randint:
    If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.
2. Random:
    If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.
3. Choice:
    Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
4. shuffle: function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

5. Randrange:
    Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

## *Risk Analysis* 
   
    Why do we use Risk Analysis?
    In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.


*The perspective of Risk Assessment*

* ***Effect***: To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.
* ***Cause***: To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.
* ***Likelihood***: To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement wonâ€™t be satisfied.
