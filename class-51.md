# Testing and Modules

## Python Modules
There are actually three different ways to define a module in Python:

1. A module can be written in Python itself.
2. A module can be written in C and loaded dynamically at run-time, like the re (regular expression) module.
3. A built-in module is intrinsically contained in the interpreter, like the itertools module.


A moduleâ€™s contents are accessed the same way in all three cases: with the import statement.

## What is Pytest
 Pytest is a testing framework which allows us to write test codes using python. You can write code to test anything like database , API, even UI if you want. But pytest is mainly being used in industry to write tests for APIs.

> pytest: helps you write better programs

The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

### *Some of the advantages of pytest are*
* Very easy to start with because of its simple and easy syntax.
* Can run tests in parallel.
* Can run a specific test or a subset of tests
* Automatically detect tests
* Skip tests
* Open source

## Recursion
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH),Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.
