# Images

>Controlling the size and alignment of
your images using CSS keeps rules that
affect the presentation of your page in
the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box. 

Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.

Whenever you use consistently
sized images across a site,
you can use CSS to control
the dimensions of the
images, instead of putting the
dimensions in the HTML.

Rather than using the ```<img>```
element's align attribute, web
page authors are increasingly
using the float property to align
images. There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved:

1. The float property is added
to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image
2. New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in
addition to classes that indicate
the size of the image.

```
It is also common to add a margin to the image to ensure that the text does not touch their edges.
```

By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel
element using the display
property with a value of block.

>Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:
1. On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center. 

2. On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.

The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box. 

CSS3 is going to introduce the
ability to specify a gradient for
the background of a box. The
gradient is created using the
background-image property
and, at the time of writing,
different browsers required a
different syntax 

1. You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.
2. Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.
3. You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.
4. Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.
5. You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.
6. To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.




# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

The Basics
Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.
At the heart of SEO is the idea of
working out which terms people
are likely to enter into a search
engine to find your site and then
using these terms in the right
places on your site to increase
the chances that search engines
will show a link to your site in
their results.
In order to determine who comes
first in the search results, search
engines do not only look at what
appears on your site. They also
consider how many sites link
to you (and how relevant those
links are). For this reason, SEO
is often split into two areas:
on-page techniques and off-page
techniques. 

In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability. 
1. Page Title
2. URL / Web Address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Image Alt Text
7. Page Descriptions


## Domain Names & Hosting 

In order to put your site on the web you will
need a domain name and web hosting.

DOMAIN NAMES
Your domain name is your web
address (e.g. google.com or bbc.
co.uk). There are many websites
that allow you to register domain
names. Usually you will have to
pay an annual fee to keep that
domain name.
These sites usually have a form
that allows you to check whether
your preferred domain name is
available, and because millions
of domain names have already
been registered, it might take
you a while to find the one that is
right for your site.
A lot of sites that offer domain
name registration also offer web
hosting.


WEB HOSTING 
So that other people can see
your site, you will need to upload
it to a web server. Web servers
are special computers that are
constantly connected to the
Internet. They are specially set
up to serve web pages when
they are requested.
With the exception of some very
large sites, most websites live on
web servers run by web hosting
companies. This is usually far
cheaper and more reliable than
trying to run your own web
servers.
There are lots of different types
of hosting on offer. We will now
take a look at some of the key
things that will help you choose
which hosting company to use.

1. Search engine optimization helps visitors find your
sites when using search engines.
2. Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to
see how many people visit your site, how they find it,
and what they do when they get there.
3. To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a
domain name and web hosting.
4. FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
local computer to your web server.
5. Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email
newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
